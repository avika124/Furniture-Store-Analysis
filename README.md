FURNITURE STORE ANALYSIS

📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes customer behavior and product performance in a furniture store using data-driven techniques. The analysis applies Recency, Frequency, and Monetary (RFM) segmentation to classify customers into different categories, such as "Best Customers" and "At Risk" groups. Additionally, product sales performance is evaluated based on revenue and units sold to identify top-performing and underperforming items.

By leveraging Python and its powerful data analysis libraries, this project provides actionable insights into customer retention, product marketing strategies, and inventory management.
